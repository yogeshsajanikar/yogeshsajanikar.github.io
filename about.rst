title: About
---

My name is Yogesh Sajanikar and I live in Pune, India. I have been
programming since 1996 using C/C++, Scheme, Scala, Python, and
Haskell. I have worked with Geometric Software, Bentley Systems,
Standard and Chartered. I am currently working with HCL Technologies
at Pune as an Enterprise Architect.

I also work for a startup `Traderwave <http://www.traderwave.com>`_
and help build a various features for technical trading.

Haskell has been my favourite since I started working with it
sicne 2010. I have been systematically trying to make use of
functional languages at my work and commercial projects I have a
chance to contribute at my work. I started Haskell Meetup in Pune.

I like to write solid geometry algoirthms related to solid
modelling. I also contributed to `ACIS solid modeller
<https://www.spatial.com/products/3d-acis-modeling>`_ by developing
some features and enhancements related to variable radius blend
surfaces. 

Recently, I am interested in formal methods in Computer Science such
as Temporal Logic and Model Checker such as TLA+.
