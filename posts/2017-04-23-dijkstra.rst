title: Thinking and Writing
---

Today I was going through the legendary Edger W Dijkstra's home
page. I need not say anything about his contributions and influences
that he holds over generations of computer scientists to come. One can
not but notice how prolific writer that he was. How comprehensive his
writings were, and how carefully he would write his thoughts.

Leslie Lamport in his book Specifying Systems quotes Guindon, *Writing
is a nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is*.

I have a reason to remember this quote and Dijkstra's extensive
numbered EWDs. Recently, we have been discussing a lot about a product
idea at my work. So much so that we had already spent about a year in
discussing without much of an outcome. Probably we created dozens of
power point presentations, small POCs, technical evaluations, but all
of those could not conclude into anything that was useful in any
sense.

Then I started writing notes about what we have discussed and the way
of communicating to different people in a very formal way. We still
have a *powerpoint* and *discussion* culture, however, my perspective
got clarified a lot, and many things that could not be said over a
*powerpoint*, I could find myself writing in words.
